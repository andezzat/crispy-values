# Values Footprints
## How to setup developer environment
1. Make sure you've got Node.js installed.
2. Navigate to Github Desktop after logging in and choose to clone `crispy-values` to your desired folder (I use `C:\Users\Andrew\Sites\`)
3. Go to the repo's directory using your command line (I use PowerShell on Windows) and execute `npm i`, this will install all node modules needed to run this project.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the build and an instance of a webpack-dev-server. Go to the URL the web server is hosted on. (Default: `http://localhost:8080`)
5. Happy Coding! ^_^
