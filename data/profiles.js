  finalPrompt: `Your values profile may help you understand more about what you care about and how that might affect the place you choose to work or the companies you choose to support.
  It may also help you understand your motivations for a particular project you are starting or a fundraising campaign you are launching.
  Searching through the values profiles may also help you think about why people work with you and support you.
  Each values profile reveals a little bit about what you value and how you see the world.
  As you change over time, the things you care about may also change. We encourage you to check back and see if your values have changed.
  This might be particularly useful as you’re thinking through a career change or a big life decision.
  We also hope to build more content and more tools over time as we work with more individuals and more companies to refine our research.
  If you are keen to understand more about how your organization can work with us to link values and value,
  please contact us (find our contacty details at the bottom of the page) and we’re happy to talk to you about how we help companies understand customer and employee engagement with our growing suite of values tools.`,
